# Outreach_Dashboard
Welcome to Outreach_Dashboard, an alpha prototype for Serendipity STEM teachers to manage curriculum and resources admist distance learning. 

During the COVID-19, the inability to communicate face to face often made it harder to convey ideas and share centralized resources. To solve this issue, the Outreach_Dashboard aims to implement a live curriculum database that is protected by Firebase aunthentication.
