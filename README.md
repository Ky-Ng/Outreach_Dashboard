# Serendipity Backpack
Welcome to Serendipity Backpack, an alpha prototype for Serendipity STEM teachers to manage curriculum and resources amidst distance learning.


During the COVID-19, the inability to communicate face to face often made it harder to convey ideas and share centralized resources. To solve this issue, the Outreach_Dashboard aims to implement a live curriculum database that is protected by Firebase authentication.
